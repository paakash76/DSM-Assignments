    "1. Built-in Function:\n",
    "   A built-in function is a function that is already defined in the Python programming language and is readily available      for use without requiring any additional steps. These functions are part of the Python standard library and provide        commonly used functionality. Examples of built-in functions in Python include 'print()', 'len()', 'type()', and            'range()'.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. User-defined Function:\n",
    "   A user-defined function is created by the programmer to perform specific tasks or operations as needed. These functions    are defined by the user and can be customized to suit their requirements. User-defined functions enhance code              modularity, reusability, and maintainability. They can be defined using the 'def' keyword followed by a function name,        parameters, and a block of code to execute."
