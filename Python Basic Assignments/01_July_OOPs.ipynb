    "Q.1: What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to structure and design software systems by organizing code into objects that represent real-world entities or concepts. OOP aims to promote modular, reusable, and maintainable code through the use of classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several key principles and goals associated with OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: OOP encourages encapsulating related data and behavior into objects. This means that the internal details of an object are hidden from the outside world, and only the necessary interface is exposed, allowing for better code organization and reducing dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: OOP allows the creation of abstract data types through classes and interfaces. Abstraction allows programmers to focus on essential features and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It provides a level of simplicity and allows for easier maintenance and code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: OOP supports the concept of inheritance, where classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. This promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, facilitating better organization and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: OOP enables polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. This flexibility allows for writing code that can work with objects of different types, providing a way to generalize and reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these goals, OOP aims to improve software development by enhancing code modularity, reusability, maintainability, and extensibility. It helps in managing complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units (objects), each with its own state and behavior."

    "Q.2: What is an object in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans: In Python, an object is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a self-contained entity that combines data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, almost everything is an object, including built-in data types (such as integers, strings, lists) as well as user-defined classes and instances of those classes. Every object belongs to a particular class, which defines its characteristics and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects allow us to create multiple instances of a class, each with its own set of attributes and behaviors. They provide a way to organize and manipulate data in a structured manner, making code more modular and reusable."

    "Q.3: What is a class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects of that class should have. A class acts as a container for attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that define the characteristics and actions of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating multiple instances of a class, we can create multiple objects that share the same structure and behavior defined by the class. Each object has its own set of attributes and can invoke methods defined in the class. Classes provide a way to organize related data and functionality, making code more organized, reusable, and maintainable."

    "\n",
    "Ans: In a class, attributes and methods define the characteristics and behavior of objects created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Attributes are variables associated with a class or its instances (objects). They represent the data or state of an object. Attributes can be defined within the class, usually in the constructor method (__init__), and accessed using the dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that perform certain actions or provide specific functionality to objects of that class. They define the behavior of objects. Methods are accessed using the dot notation, similar to attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining methods in a class, we can encapsulate related behavior and actions, allowing objects of that class to perform specific tasks. Methods can interact with the object's attributes and modify their values, as well as perform other operations."

    "Q.5: What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, class variables and instance variables are two types of variables that can be defined within a class, but they have different scopes and purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Variables:\n",
    "Class variables are variables that are shared among all instances (objects) of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any methods. Class variables are accessed using the class name or the instance name. They are typically used to store data that is common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance Variables:\n",
    "Instance variables are variables that belong to a specific instance (object) of a class. They are defined within the class's methods, typically in the constructor method (__init__). Each instance of the class can have its own set of instance variables, with different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between class variables and instance variables is that class variables are shared among all instances of a class, while each instance has its own set of instance variables with unique values. Class variables are accessed using the class name or instance name, whereas instance variables are accessed through the instance name."

    "Q.6: What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python class methods, the self parameter is a convention used to refer to the instance (object) of the class on which the method is being called. It acts as a reference to the specific instance, allowing the method to access and modify the instance's attributes and invoke other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a method within a class, the first parameter of the method is typically self, although any valid parameter name can be used. However, it is strongly recommended to stick to the convention of using self to ensure code clarity and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using self, methods can access and modify the attributes and invoke other methods of the instance they belong to. It allows for the encapsulation of behavior specific to each instance and facilitates interaction between the instance and its methods."
