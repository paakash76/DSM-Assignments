    "\n",
    "Ans: The main difference between logging and print statements in Python is their purpose and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Purpose: The print statement is primarily used for displaying information during development or debugging, whereas the logging module is designed specifically for generating log messages for various purposes such as debugging, error tracking, and monitoring in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Output Control: print statements output directly to the console, while the logging module provides flexibility in directing log messages to different outputs like files, email, databases, or remote servers. Additionally, logging supports different log levels, allowing you to filter and control the verbosity of log output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility: The logging module allows you to format log messages, add timestamps, include additional contextual information, and handle log messages in a more structured manner. It provides finer-grained control over logging behavior and allows you to customize log output based on the application's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world application, it is recommended to use the logging module over print statements for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maintainability: Logging statements can be easily disabled or enabled or redirected to different outputs without modifying the code, making it more maintainable and adaptable to different deployment environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logging allows you to include detailed information about the application's state, variable values, and execution flow, aiding in debugging and troubleshooting issues in production environments where direct access to the console may not be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Production Readiness: Using the logging module ensures that your application is ready for production deployment, as it provides a standardized way to capture and manage log messages, which are essential for monitoring, performance analysis, and error tracking.\n",
