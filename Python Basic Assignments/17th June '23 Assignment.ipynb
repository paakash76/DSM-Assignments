    "\n",

This means that the program will search for an appropriate except block in the calling code or the next higher-level try-except block. If no matching except block is found in any higher-level code, the program will terminate and display a traceback message that includes information about the unhandled exception. "

    "\n",
    "- Bare Except Block: A bare except block, written as except:, catches and handles all exceptions, regardless of their type. It can make it difficult to diagnose and handle specific exceptions properly because it doesn't provide information about the specific exception that occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specific Exception Type: Specifying a specific exception type, such as except ValueError:, allows you to catch and handle only the specified exception. This approach provides more control and clarity in handling specific exceptions and allows for different error handling strategies based on the type of exception encountered. It is generally recommended to handle specific exceptions whenever possible for more precise error handling."

    "\n",
    "e. OverflowError: This error is raised when the result of a numerical operation exceeds the maximum representable value for a numeric type. It typically occurs when performing calculations that result in a value beyond the range that can be stored in the given numeric type.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. TabError: This error is raised when indentation in Python code is incorrect, specifically related to the use of tabs and spaces. It occurs when there is a mix of tabs and spaces or inconsistent indentation levels, leading to a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "g. ValueError: This error is raised when an operation or function receives an argument of the correct type but with an invalid value. It occurs when a value is passed to a function or operation that is not appropriate or falls outside the expected range or format.\n",
